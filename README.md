Project: Mini Stack Overflow
Objective
Build a simplified Stack Overflow-like application with basic features such as user authentication, question creation, answering questions, voting, and displaying results.

Project Requirements
1. Functional Requirements
User Authentication
Implement user registration and login functionality.
Users must be logged in to:
Create questions.
Post answers.
Vote on questions or answers.
Basic user profile:
Username
Email (unique)
Password (hashed using a secure method like ASP.NET Core Identity or a similar library).
Question Management
Users should be able to create a question with the following fields:
Title
Description
Tags (optional, comma-separated)
Display a list of all questions on the home page with:
Title
Number of answers
Total votes (sum of upvotes and downvotes)
Answer Management
Logged-in users should be able to add answers to a question.
Answers should include:
Answer text
The username of the logged-in user who posted the answer.
Display all answers for a question below the question details.
Voting System
Logged-in users should be able to upvote or downvote both questions and answers.
Each user can vote only once per question or answer (upvote or downvote).
Total votes (upvotes - downvotes) should be displayed.
Filtering and Sorting
Questions can be filtered by tags.
Questions can be sorted by:
Most answered
Most voted
Newest

2. Non-Functional Requirements
Technology Stack
Use .NET Core (ASP.NET Core MVC or API).
Use Entity Framework Core for database interactions.
Use a SQL Server database.
Frontend can use Razor Pages, Bootstrap, or basic HTML/CSS framework for simplicity.
Design Considerations
Responsive design for desktop and mobile views.
Minimal UI is acceptable but should be clean and functional.
Code Quality
Use proper naming conventions.
Ensure code readability and maintainability (e.g., comments where necessary).
Follow the MVC or layered architecture patterns.
Authentication Security
Use password hashing and validation.
Implement session or JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
Time Constraint
The project must be completed within 2â€“3 days.

Project Deliverables
Source Code
Share the project repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or zip file).
Provide a README.md file with instructions on how to run the project.
Database
Include the SQL script or database migration files for creating necessary tables.
Features Checklist
Provide a checklist of features implemented, including any additional ones beyond the requirements.

Evaluation Criteria
Core Features Implementation
Completeness and correctness of the required features.
Code Quality
Clarity, organization, and adherence to best practices.
Database Design
Proper table structure with relationships (e.g., users, questions, and answers).
User Experience
Usability and design of the application.
Authentication Security
Proper implementation of secure user authentication.
Creativity
Any extra features or unique approaches.

Bonus (Optional)
